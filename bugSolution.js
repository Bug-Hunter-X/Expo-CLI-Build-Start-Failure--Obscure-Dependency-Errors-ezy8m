The solution involves carefully reviewing and correcting the project's `package.json` file.  Common fixes include:

* **Updating dependencies:** Run `expo upgrade` to update Expo modules and their dependencies to the latest compatible versions.
* **Resolving conflicts:** Manually examine `package.json` to identify potentially conflicting dependencies (different versions of the same package).  Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to investigate dependencies in more detail.  Consider using version ranges (`^` or `~`) to allow for minor updates.
* **Cleaning the cache:**  Run `expo prebuild --clean` to remove cached build files that may be interfering with the build process.
* **Reinstalling dependencies:** Run `expo install` to refresh the node modules. If you're using yarn, run `yarn install`.
* **Checking for missing dependencies:** Verify all required dependencies for your used Expo modules and React Native features are listed in `package.json`. 
* **Correcting typos:**  Double check for any typos or syntax errors in your `package.json` file (especially in version numbers or dependency names).

The corrected `package.json`  (demonstrated in `bugSolution.js`) will resolve the build errors and allow the app to start successfully.
