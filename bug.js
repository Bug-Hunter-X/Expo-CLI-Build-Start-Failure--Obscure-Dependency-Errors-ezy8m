This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has an outdated or improperly configured `package.json` file, especially concerning dependencies related to React Native or Expo modules.  The error message itself might not be very descriptive, often just indicating a general failure during the build or start process.  Sometimes, related errors about missing or mismatched native modules appear, pointing towards the root cause.
